        <h1>Huricane Preparedness</h1>
        <h2>Are you prepared for a Hurricane?</h2>
        <p>
          With hurricane season starting in June and ending in November, the
          threat of hurricanes in South Florida are very real. Are you and your
          home ready for a major hurricane? Create a checklist to make sure you
          have everything you need!

        <h2>Stock Up on Food and Water</h2>
        <p>
          Although there is no reason to panic buy everything at the grocery
          store, you do want to make sure you are well prepared for the upcoming
          hurricane. You should have at least a three-day supply of
          non-perishable food and water. A good rule of thumb with water is to
          have one gallon of water per person per day. Avoid drinking any tap
          water at this time, but if absolutely necessary make sure to boil any
          water before consumption. <br />

        <h2>Have a First Aid Kit</h2>
        <p>
          Every household should have a well-equipped first aid kit in their
          possession in the case of a hurricane. Some of the items that should
          be included in this kit should be bandages, gauze pads, tweezers,
          antiseptic, gloves, and soap.

        <h2>Put Up Window Shutters</h2>
        <p>
          With hurricane force winds and flying debris, you want your windows
          protected. Some houses in South Florida are equipped with sliding
          hurricane shutters which are used to easily cover windows while others
          require a little more work to be manually put on. No matter what type
          of shutters you have, it is important to get your shutters up as soon
          as a hurricane watch is put into effect in your area. <br />

        <h2>Keep Important Documents Safe</h2>
        <p>
          Any important documents that you wish to keep safe should be kept in a
          sealed waterproof container that can be stored in a dry and easily
          accessible area. Some documents you may want to store are
          certificates, identification cards, medical records, and insurance
          information. For those who want to be prepared for any emergency,
          there are waterproof and fireproof

          available in which these documents can be stored in at all times. For
          another level of safety, any document you wish to protect should also
          be electronically scanned in and saved.

        <h2>Know Your Flooding Zones</h2>
        <p>
          Knowing the flooding zones around your house is an important part of
          preparing for a hurricane in South Florida. Most of the state is under
          a flood warning during any strong storm, therefore knowing how likely
          your homes elevation and how much rain it would take to flood is
          important in helping prepare for any storm. There are various online
          tools to help find your flooding zones, our favorite being

        <h2>Secure Electronics</h2>
        <p>
          In the scenario that your house does flood, you want all of the
          electronics in your house to be secure, this meaning that all
          electronics are unplugged and stored up high to avoid any contact with
          water. If any electronic devices are small enough, store them in an
          airtight waterproof bag.
